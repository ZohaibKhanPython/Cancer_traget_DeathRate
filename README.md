Predicting Death
Using Linear Regression Model to predict death_rate
KFold Validation with 5 splits
Using Pipeline feature to implement
                          ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
                         ('poly', PolynomialFeatures(1)), ##1 is producing better results
                          ('lm', LinearRegression()
 Potentiall improve model by using SVM or PCA to reduce features, I will aim to implement feature selection to select the best featues to put through model.
